## Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
* cookies are data messages that get passed to a browser from a server and gets stored in temporary memory so that certain information sticks around when you do things on a webpage to let you start where you left off etc., and so the server can recognize you. cookies seem to be passed as http headers when the client requests from the server and when the server responds to the client.
