## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
* Linux was built to be lightweight, portable, small, yet good at one thing. It seems as though linux allows the user to do many things, assuming they know what they are doing. This gives the user a lot of power if used correctly.

## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
* Virtual Private Servers are copies of an operating system that someone can buy from a hosting service and basically add any type of software etc that they want. The advantages of this are that you can build whatever the OS will let you and destroy and rebuild very easily, because its all virtual. Also, its much cheaper than buying for a physical server, and you can customize your plan for what you need and not pay for extra things you dont need.

## Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
* When working on the root, you could accidentally delete everything. security issues can arise because you give it full permission to do whatever.
