# I plan on doing the following for developing some skills in Jquery:
* W3 schools, stack overflow and codeacademy are helpful resources to check out
* learn how to get jquery running on my programs 
* learn how to create a basic jquery project
* try to make my project execute some common jquery uses.
## things that seemed most effective:
* using stack overflow for the syntax on how to link jquery to my html file.
* W3 schools tutorials also helped with getting started
* code academy actually helped troubleshoot getting the jquery linked to the html file, after many failed attempts with other learning platforms
