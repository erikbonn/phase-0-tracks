<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
      The semantic tags give meaning to the content or basically describe literally what is inside the element. One can organize their webpage efficiently and define what is going where. Non-semantic tags can be a little less clear.

 Which ones do you see as most useful? 
 	Headers and footers seem like they would be important to recognize immediately, and knowing what is an article could help you know that content in that element can stand on its own.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? 
	From my research, it looks like it loads html first first and foremost, and then for the most part goes from top to bottom when loading elements of html.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	 Sublime is a great tool and if you know your way around you can become very efficient in writing code. I believe I'll probably make a lot of snippets when there are certain re-usable blocks of code that could be tedious to write.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? 
	The most difficult part was telling the difference between article and section, but after looking it up on W3 and seeing that an article can stand on its own, helped me make that distinction. I'll be reviewing the information there to better understand the purpose of all of the semantic elements.
