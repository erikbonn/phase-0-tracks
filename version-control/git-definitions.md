# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
   * Version control is a tool for programmers that is a series of steps we take while making changes to code to assure we backup the working master information while fully documenting and saving all new additions to that code base. It is usefull because, it is a process that makes it harder for bad code to get merged into master code because it gets reviewed by others on the team beforehand. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
   * A branch is a second copy of the master that you can work on and make changes to and merge back into the master in your terminal. You would use them so that you can work on multiple things at once, and then merge the changes back into the master in an organized and documented way.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
   * A commit is recording the changes you made to a repository on your terminal. basically a save point for reference. A good message explains what changes were made, a unique ID, an author and email address, and a time stamp for reference.

* What is a merge conflict?
   * A merge conflict is when you want to merge a branch into another, but there are differences (other than the commit you've made on one side) between the branches that make a discrepancy. one must look at the differences and fix whatever is different before a merge can be made.
